The law enforcement community, uh, uh, you know, has to, has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which, uh, grievous acts are done to, uh, to, you know, to get somebody into a, a situation where they're going to be guilty of, of a crime.

Now, I, I'm, at this juncture I, you know, I'm, I'm not sure, you know, what constitutes a, a technicality. You know, that, that's what all these, these hearings are about and that's what all these, you know, court cases are about.

And if he didn't like what you did, he killed you. And that has, that's pretty effective. Uh, you know, it's not good for civil rights, I guess, but it's pretty effective in that, you know, you've got to get along in the community and if you don't you'll perish. Either by the hand of your, your, your master or by being pushed out in the woods. So, I, I, I mean as, as man has gotten more complicated so all of the, uh, imaginations to, uh, you know, protect him from, from being, uh, dumped on by, uh, civilian authority in, in in criminal actions, especially, you know, murder cases and that sort of thing.\\nB:: Well, it seems like well it, it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished, and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes, albeit it seems that we are failing in that, in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off. Um, for instance, um there's a case a few years back where, uh, someone, uh, someone who's being convicted for, was under a was going to trial for murder, was let off because of a technicality in that.
